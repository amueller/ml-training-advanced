# KNN with scikit-learn

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=1)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("accuracy: {:.2f}".format(knn.score(X_test, y_test)))
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)
```
accuracy: 0.77

# Overfitting and Underfitting

![:scale 80%](images/overfitting_underfitting_cartoon_full.png)

???
If we use too simple a model, this is often called underfitting, while
if we use to complex a model, this is called overfitting. And somewhere
in the middle is a sweet spot.
Most models have some way to tune model complexity, and we’ll see many
of them in the next couple of weeks.
So going back to nearest neighbors, what parameters correspond to high
model complexity and what to low model complexity? high n_neighbors =
low complexity!

# Cross-validation + test set

![:scale 70%](images/grid_search_cross_validation.png)

???
Here is how the workflow looks like when we are using five-fold
cross-validation together with a test-set split for adjusting parameters.
We start out by splitting of the test data, and then we perform
cross-validation on the training set.
Once we found the right setting of the parameters, we retrain on the
whole training set and evaluate on the test set.

# GridSearchCV
.smaller[
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y)


param_grid = {'n_neighbors':  np.arange(1, 15, 2)}

grid = GridSearchCV(KNeighborsClassifier(), param_grid=param_grid, cv=10)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("best mean cross-validation score: {:.3f}".format(grid.best_score_))
print("best parameters:", grid.best_params_))

print("test-set score: {:.3f}".format(grid.score(X_test, y_test)))
```

```
best mean cross-validation score: 0.967
best parameters: {'n_neighbors': 9}
test-set score: 0.993
```
]
???
Here is an example.
We still need to split our data into training and test set.
We declare the parameters we want to search over as a dictionary. In
this example the parameter is just n_neighbors and the values we want
to try out are a range. The keys of the dictionary are the parameter
names and the values are the parameter settings we want to try. If you
specify multiple parameters, all possible combinations are tried. This
is where the name grid-search comes from - it’s an exhaustive search
over all possible parameter combinations that you specify.

GridSearchCV is a class, and it behaves just like any other model in
scikit-learn, with a fit, predict and score method.
It’s what we call a meta-estimator, since you give it one estimator,
here the KneighborsClassifier, and from that GridSearchCV constructs a
new estimator that does the parameter search for you.
You also specify the parameters you want to search, and the
cross-validation strategy.
Then GridSearchCV does all the other things we talked about, it does the
cross-validation and parameter selection, and retrains a model with the
best parameter settings that were found.
We can check out the best cross-validation score and the best parameter
setting with the best_score_ and best_params_ attributes.
And finally we can compute the accuracy on the test set, simply but
using the score method! That will use the retrained model under the hood.
