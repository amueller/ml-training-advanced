# A note on preprocessing

???

I want to talk a bit more about preprocessing and
cross-validation here, and introduce pipelines.

#Leaking Information

What we did was we trained the scaler on the training data,
and then applied cross-validation to the scaled data. Tha’s
what’s show on the left. The problem is that we use the
information of all of the training data for scaling, so in
particular the information in the test fold. This is also known
as information leakage. If we apply our model to new data,
this data will not have been used to do the scaling, so our
cross-validation will give us a biased result that might be
too optimistic.

On the right you can see how we should do it: we should only
use the training part of the data to find the mean and
standard deviation, even in cross-validation. That means
that for each split in the cross-validation, we need to scale
the data a bit differently. This basically means the scaling
should happen inside the cross-validation loop, not outside.

In practice, estimating mean and standard deviation is quite
robust and you will not see a big difference between the
two methods. But for other preprocessing steps that we’ll
see later, this might make a huge difference. So we should
get it right from the start.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
X, y = boston.data, boston.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)

scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(X_train)
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
ridge = Ridge().fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
ridge.score(X_test_scaled, y_test)
```
```
0.634
```

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
pipe = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), Ridge())
pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)
pipe.score(X_test, y_test)
```
```
0.634
```

???

Now I want to show you how to do preprocessing and crossvalidation right with scikit-learn.

At the top here you see the workflow for scaling the data and
then applying ridge again. Fit the scaler on the training set,
transform on the training set, fit ridge on the training set,
transform the test set, and evaluate the model.

Because this is such a common pattern, scikit-learn has a
tool to make this easier, the pipeline. The pipeline is an
estimator that allows you to chain multiple transformations
of the data before you apply a final model.

You can build a pipeline using the make_pipeline function.
Just provide as parameters all the estimators. All but the
last one need to have a transform method. Here we only
have two steps: the standard scaler and ridge.

make_pipeline returns an estimator that does both steps at
once. We can call fit on it to fit first the scaler and then
ridge on the scaled data, and when we call score, it
transforms the data and then evaluates the model.

The code below is exactly equivalent to the code above, only
shorter.

Let’s dive a bit more into the pipeline. Here is an
illustration of what happens with three steps, T1, T2
and Classifier. Imagine T1 to be a scaler and T2 to
be any other transformation of the data.

If we call fit on this pipeline, it will first call fit on the first
step with the input X. Then it will transform the input
X to X1, and use X1 to fit the second step, T2. Then
it will use T2 to transform the data from X1 to X2.
Then it will fit the classifier on X2.

If we call predict on some data X’, say the test set, it
will call transform on T1, creating X’1. Then it will use
T2 to transform X’1 into X’2, and call the predict
method of the classifier on X’2. This sounds a bit
complicated, but it’s really just doing “the right thing”
to apply multiple transformation steps.

.padding-top[

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor
knn_pipe = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), KNeighborsRegressor())
scores = cross_val_score(knn_pipe, X_train, y_train, cv=10)
np.mean(scores), np.std(scores)
```
```
(0.745, 0.106)
```
]
???

How does that help with the cross-validation problem?
Because now all steps are contain in pipeline, we
can simply pass the whole pipeline to crossvalidation, and all processing will happen inside the
cross-validation loop. That solve the data leakage
problem.

Here you can see how we can build a pipeline using a
standard scaler and kneighborsregressor and pass it
to cross-validation.

# Naming Steps

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
knn_pipe = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), KNeighborsRegressor())
print(knn_pipe.steps)
```
```
[('standardscaler', StandardScaler(with_mean=True, with_std=True)),
 ('kneighborsregressor', KNeighborsRegressor(algorithm='auto', ...))]
```

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
pipe = Pipeline((("scaler", StandardScaler()),
                 ("regressor", KNeighborsRegressor)))
```

???

But let’s talk a bit more about pipelines, because they
are great. The pipeline has an attribute called steps,
which --- contains its steps. Steps is a list of tuples,
where the first entry is a string and the second is an
estimator (model). The string is the “name” that is
assigned to this step in the pipeline. You can see
here that our first step is called “standardscaler” in all
lower case letters, and the second is called
kneighborsregressor, also all lower case letters.

By default, step names are just lowercased classnames. You can also name the steps yourself using
the Pipeline class directly. Then you can specify the
steps as tuples of name and estimator.
make_pipeline is just a shortcut to generate the names
automatically.

# Pipeline and GridSearchCV
.small-padding-top[
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

knn_pipe = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), KNeighborsRegressor())
param_grid = {'kneighborsregressor__n_neighbors': range(1, 10)}
grid = GridSearchCV(knn_pipe, param_grid, cv=10)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(grid.best_params_)
print(grid.score(X_test, y_test))
```

```
{'kneighborsregressor__n_neighbors': 7}
0.60
```
]

???

These names are important for using pipelines with gridsearch. Recall that for using GridSearchCV you need to
specify a parameter grid as a dictionary, where the keys
are the parameter names. If you are using a pipeline inside
GridSearchCV, you need to specify not only the parameter
name, but also the step name – because multiple steps
could have a parameter with the same name.

The way to do this is to use the stepname, then two
underscores, and then the parameter name, as the key for
the param_grid dictionary.

You can see that the best_params_ will have this same
format.

This way you can tune the parameters of all steps in a
pipeline at once!

And you don’t have to worry about leaking information, since
all transformations are contained in the pipeline.

You should always use pipelines for preprocessing. Not only
does it make your code shorter, it also makes it less likely
that you have bugs.
